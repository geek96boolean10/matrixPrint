# matrixPrint

An experiment in creating a simple UI for command-line interfaces.

I intend on eventually using this as a straightforward low-resolution GUI for a home server.

I'm almost certain there are solutions online that are exactly the same as what I'm doing, but I am also using this as practice with using Python.
